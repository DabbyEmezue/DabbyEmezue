- 👋 Hi, I’m Dabby. I build the back-end of web applications with Node.js, Nest,js or Golang. I also use python for algorithm problems. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that would have a high impact in the nearest future.
- I love to build solutions to real-life problems with code.
